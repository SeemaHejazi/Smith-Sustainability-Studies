Smith Sustainability Studies System

Supervisor: Juergen Dingel


Our clients are interested in implementing Green Information Systems which use Information Systems to improve the eco-sustainability of businesses and society. The purpose of the system is for researchers to run ongoing studies related to pro-environmental behaviour to better understand what stimuli could reduce personal energy consumption from electronics in the workplace. The Smith Sustainability Studies System is a user-friendly web-application which will assist them in the creation and conduction of studies by offering administrative control over the design of each study, the creation and management of participantsâ€™ accounts, the ability to monitor study progress, extract and analyse data, and finally provide interactive material in the form of persuasive information and reports of energy usage. Study participants, referred to as users, can input daily data as well as track their progress and standings in the system depending on their constraints in the study.
